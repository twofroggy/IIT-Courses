To run generate-dataset.sh for part 3a:
First execute generate-dataset.sh with the filename you want it to be under
 and the number of records you want it to contain. 
To time the file, use the time command.
Execute by writing the following:
time ./generate-dataset.sh <filename> <num_records>
What should show up is the time it took to execute the file with the 
amount of records you specified you wanted the file to run for.
You'll have generated two datasets, the random integers and the random strings.
Both datasets get combined into one big called called <filename>.

To run sort-data.sh for part 3b:
First execute sort-data.sh with the filename you used in part 3a, be sure it's spelled exactly the same.
To time the file, use the time command.
Execute by writing the following:
time ./sort-data.sh <filename>
What should show up is the time it took to sort the file created in part 3a and put into another file with the name: <filename>.sorted. 

To run graph-the-data.py for part 3c:
I have already inputted the data needed to make the graph, so running it again would give you a png file of a graph with the name: recnum-vs-time-graph.png.
The file will be in the same folder as the other files generated from running the commands before. 
You can run the file by writing the following:
./graph-the-data.py
