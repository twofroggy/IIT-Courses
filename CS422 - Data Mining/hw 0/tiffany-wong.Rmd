```{r}
# scatterplot 
plot(x=cars$speed, y=cars$dist, 
     col="#69b3a2", 
     xlab="Speed", ylab="Distance", 
     main="Scatterplot: Speed vs Distance")

max.speed <- max(cars$speed)
min.dist  <- min(cars$dist) 
str <- paste0("Maximum speed is ", max.speed, ", and minimum distance is ", 
              min.dist)
